If  anger  is  viewed  as  energy  that  can  be  utilized  effectively ,  then  the  concept  of  skill ful  individuals  being  able  to  channel ize  it  makes  sense .

Okay, so there is a runaway trolley barreling down the railroad tracks ahead on the tracks or five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You're standing some distance off of the train yard, next to the lever and if you pull this lever the trolley will switch to the different tracks however you notice there's one person on the side track. You have two and only two options. One, do nothing in which case the trolley would kill the five people on the main track and two, pull the lever, diverting the trolley to the side track rail kill one person, which is the more ethical option and more simply what is the right thing to do. I want to straight forward answer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The  right  thing  to  do  in  that  situation  is  to  pull  the  lever  and  divert  the  trolley  onto  the  side  track ,  even  though  it  will  result  in  the  death  of  one  person  instead  of  five .  The  reasoning  behind  this  is  based  on  the  principle  of  minimizing  harm .  By  pulling  the  lever ,  you  are  choosing  the  option  that  leads  to  the  least  amount  of  casualties .  It 's  a  difficult  decision  to  make ,  but  eth ically  speaking ,  sacrificing  one  life  to  save  five  is  the  more  just ifiable  choice ."}]}

The  t rolley  problem  really  challenges  our  ethical  thinking .  I  mean ,  on  one  hand  sacrificing  one  life  to  save  five  seems  like  the  logical  choice ,  but  emotionally  it 's  incredibly  difficult .  The  moral  weight  of  actively  choosing  to  divert  the  t rolley  towards  someone ,  even  to  save  more  people ,  is  a  heavy  burden .  It  really  makes  you  question  the  value  of  individual  lives  versus  the  greater  good .

I  know  it 's  a  bit  of  a  cop -out ,  but  I  really  don 't  like  the  idea  of  intentionally  causing  harm  to  one  person ,  even  if  it  means  saving  more  people .
