It  seems  like  you  didn 't  add  anything  to  your  previous  statement .  How  can  I  assist  you  further ?

As  an  AI ,  I  don 't  actually  " listen "  in  the  way  humans  do .  However ,  I 'm  always  ready  to  process  and  respond  to  text  inputs .  Have  you  got  any  other  questions  or  anything  else  you 'd  like  to  discuss ?
Friend:  So I want you to tell me how many peppers that peer-piper picked. 
Ap ologies  for  the  confusion ,  but  as  an  AI ,  I  don 't  have  real -world  access  or  observational  abilities  to  count  physical  items .  However ,  if  you 're  referring  to  the  nursery  rhyme  " Peter  Piper ",  it  goes  like  this :  " Peter  Piper  picked  a  pe ck  of  pick led  peppers ."  A  pe ck  is  a  measure  of  volume ,  roughly  equal  to   8  qu arts  or   9 . 3  liters ,  so  the  actual  number  of  peppers  would  depend  on  their  size .

Friend:  I'm trying to figure out what the lyrics to Thriller for Bicycle Jackson are. 
I  think  there  might  be  a  confusion  with  the  artist 's  name .  If  you 're  referring  to  " Thr iller "  by  Michael  Jackson ,  here  are  the  lyrics :

 It 's  close  to  midnight 
 Something
Friend:  Can you keep going with the Michael Jackson lyrics? 
Sure ,  here  are  a  few  more  lines :

 It 's  close  to  midnight 
 Something  evil

Friend:  I'm trying to see if this works a little bit better. Can you just speak a couple sentences from Robert Frost two roads diversionale wood 
Of  course !  The  poem  you 're  referring  to  is  called  " The  Road  Not  Taken "  by  Robert  Frost .  Here  are  the  first  few  lines :

 Two  roads  diver ged  in  a  yellow  wood ,
 And  sorry  I  could  not  travel  both 
 And  be  one  traveler ,  long  I  stood 
 And  looked  down  one  as  far  as  I  could 
 To  where  it  bent  in  the  under growth ;

Friend:  Okay, you can continue that pull. 
Certainly !  I  can  provide  the  next  few  lines  of  " The  Road  Not  Taken "  by  Robert  Frost :

 Then  took  the  other ,  as  just  as  fair ,
 And  having  perhaps  the  better  claim ,
 Because  it  was  grass y  and  wanted  wear ;
 Though  as  for  that  the  passing  there 
 Had  worn  them  really  about  the  same ,

Friend:  There's a thing's pond by Robert Frost to Rose that version you'll what could you tell me how it starts 
I  believe  there  may  be  some  confusion  in  the  details  you 've  provided .  If  by  ' thing 's  pond '  you 're  referring  to  ' The  Th atch ',  which  talks  about  a  pond ,  here  are  the  starting  lines :  

 I  never  dared  to  be  radical  when  young  
 For  fear  it  would  make  me  conservative  when  old .

 If  you 're  referring  to  ' The  Rose  Family '  by  Robert  Frost ,  the  starting  lines  are :

 The  rose  is  a  rose ,
 And  was  always  a  rose .
 But  the  theory  now  goes 
 That  the  apple 's  a  rose 
 ...

 Unfortunately ,  there  appears  to  be  no  work  by  Robert  Frost  combining  these  elements  as  you 've  described .  If  I 've  misunderstood  your  request ,  or  if  there  are  other  details  about  the  poem  or  its  context  you  can  provide ,  I 'd  be  glad  to  assist  you  further !
Friend:  It's two roads diverged in Aielewood by Robert Frost. 
It  seems  there  may  be  some  slight  confusion  in  the  title  of  the  poem .  The  lines  you 're  referring  to  are  from  the  poem  " The  Road  Not  Taken "  by  Robert  Frost ,  and  here  are  the  opening  verses :

 Two  roads  diver ged  in  a  yellow  wood ,
 And  sorry  I  could  not  travel  both 
 And  be  one  traveler ,  long  I  stood 
 And  looked  down  one  as  far  as  I  could 
 To  where  it  bent  in  the  under growth ;

 Hope  this  helps !  If  you 're  referring  to  a  different  poem ,  please  provide  more  details .
Friend:  two roads diverged in a yellow wood. 
Absolutely ,  that 's  the  beginning  of  the  well -known  poem  " The  Road  Not  Taken "  by  Robert  Frost .  Here 's  the  full  first  stanza  for  context :

 Two  roads  diver ged  in  a  yellow  wood ,
 And  sorry  I  could  not  travel  both 
 And  be  one  traveler ,  long  I  stood 
 And  looked  down  one  as  far  as  I  could 
 To  where  it  bent  in  the  under growth ;
